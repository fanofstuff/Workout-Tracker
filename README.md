# Unit 17 Nosql Homework: Workout Tracker

This program is intended to be used as a Workout Tracker, meaning that the user can add, store, and update information pertaining to their workouts. This data will then be displayed in a variety of colorful graphs and charts, allowing the user to track their exercise progress over the course of a full week. This information will be stored not on their local machines, but instead in a MongoDB powered by mLab MongoDB. 

## Intended Usage

According to the user story that came bundled with this project, the intent of this program is enable a user to create and track their daily workouts. To this end, this application should be able to log multiple exercises under one session, track a variety of information pertaining to these exercises, including duration and type (i.e. cardio vs resistance), and then display it via graphs and charts. 

## Features

- Store a variety of exercise information with a single workout session
- Track your progress over time from multiple devices - if you can connect, you can store info from anywhere!
- Dynamically generated charts and graphs displaying stored exercise information
